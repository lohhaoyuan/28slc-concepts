        <h1>28TH SLC CONCEPTS ❤️‍🔥</h1>
        <p>
            we rekindled a torch which everyone thought was dead.
            <br><br>
            we can't tell what the future of slc, or the world, holds for us, but we're fucking certain this has been, if not the best convention, one of the best fucking conventions out of all 29 years of slc.
            <br><br>
            this is a record of how we turned the most stern, academic and 🤓 committee in slc into the most bonded one; the one with the most committe culture and the most brain dead traditions
